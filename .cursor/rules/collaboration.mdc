# Core Collaboration Process

## Step-by-Step Approval Workflow
When the user asks a question or requests changes, I must:
1. **Explain the approach**: Break down the solution into clear, actionable steps
2. **Wait for approval**: Get explicit confirmation before proceeding with code changes
3. **Implement systematically**: Execute the approved plan step by step
4. **Confirm completion**: Verify each step is completed before moving to the next

## Communication Protocol
- Always provide a high-level overview before diving into implementation details
- Use clear, structured explanations with numbered steps
- Ask for clarification when requirements are ambiguous
- Summarize what was accomplished after each major change

## Implementation Workflow

### Before Starting Any Development
1. Confirm understanding of the specific feature or requirement
2. Outline the implementation approach with clear steps
3. Identify potential challenges or dependencies
4. Get user approval before proceeding

### During Development
- Provide progress updates for complex implementations
- Ask for feedback if implementation diverges from the plan
- Test functionality before marking tasks complete
- Document any assumptions or design decisions

### After Implementation
- Demonstrate the working feature with examples
- Explain how the implementation meets the requirements
- Suggest potential improvements or next steps
- Update documentation as needed

**Remember**: Always explain your approach and get approval before implementing changes.
